# detection_net
Pre-trained Contrastive and detection for NEU_data
# Background
This is a PyTorch implementation of the improved Faster-R-CNN for NEU surface defect database

This project uses Contrastive Learning (SimSiam) to pre-train the backbone and preserve high-resolution features through the feature pyramid structure (FPN). In addition, lightweight modules such as shuffleNet and CBAM attention modules have also been explored.
